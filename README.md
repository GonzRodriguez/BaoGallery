### Since I show a beautiful picture of a girl that wasn't clearly aware that she was being captured by a camera, I had this idea that everyone would want to be the protagonist of that picture. In fact, she was the one who posted on facebook. 

Upload your pictures, manage your profile, get in touch with your costumers via email and sell the photograpy only to authorized people. 

A side app will be created using react native connected to this project in order to collect the customers emails on the street. Once you upload their images, we'll send them an email with the link they need to get acces to the photos.
